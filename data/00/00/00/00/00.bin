314
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,333
Monsters? No one prepared me
for actual monsters.

315
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,875
You are too late, Captain Carter.

316
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,291
I have summoned the champion of H--

317
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,000
(SCREAMS)

318
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:57,875
Whoa!

319
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,125
Okay, maybe we need a plan.

320
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:04,208
-Stark was right. Indestructible.
-(ROGERS GROANS)

321
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:08,333
Steve! Steve.
Come on, pal, don't give up on me.

322
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:11,208
Hey, I need a hand!
Come on, help me get him out of here!

323
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,875
No. You gotta get me in the suit.

324
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,916
The generator should give it enough power.

325
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,500
-Yeah, but for how long?
-Long enough.

326
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,458
Maybe. Punch it.

327
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,916
I'm up for anything, but this is crazy.

328
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,708
Yeah, so is Steve Rogers.

329
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,375
-You okay?
-ROGERS: Yep.

330
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,375
Good, because we don't have all day.

331
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,791
-ROGERS: Now, where's Peggy?
-She drew the high card.

332
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,541
(SCREAMS)

333
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,583
Its tentacles appear to be growing.

334
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,875
At the rate it's spreading,
it could devour Europe.

335
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:04,333
If I can get to the controls,

336
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:06,666
I can transpose the ingress
and do science stuff.

337
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,125
You mean transpose
the polarity and reverse the suction?

338
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,500
Being the genius is my thing.

339
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:12,500
(HOWARD SCREAMS)

340
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:16,166
Show-off. Come on,
come on, speak to me, baby.

341
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:19,833
-And everything's in German. Great.
-Well, figure it out.

342
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,291
(GROANS)

343
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,958
Red, green, blue...
Who paints a button blue?

344
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:36,958
Don't tell me the American playboy
needs help pushing buttons.

345
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:39,041
Hedy Lamarr
and I spent a weekend together,

346
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,833
but she wasn't teaching me German!

347
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,625
-Steve?
-Did you miss me?

348
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:01,708
-Every second.
-I told you it was indestructible.

349
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,083
You were saying, Howard?

350
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:12,041
Oh, wow. Who ordered the calamari?

351
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,541
(ROARING)

352
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,875
(SCREAMING)

353
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,041
-Steve!
-ROGERS: On it!

354
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,791
Go get 'em, Steve!

355
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,000
I can't close it!
This thing is holding it open!

356
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:47,208
Then I'll push it back to hell!

357
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,750
(PEGGY YELLING)

358
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:52,416
(GROANS)

359
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:54,500
ROGERS: Peggy!

360
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,875
No, no, no!

361
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,375
-Peggy, no!
-I have to. I can end this.

362
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,708
You owe me a dance lesson.

363
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,958
Yes, Saturday night.

364
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,083

365
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,291

-FURY: Ma'am.
-(PEGGY GRUNTS)

367
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,166
Please, put down the sword.

368
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:28,291
Uh, sir? That's Captain Carter.

369
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,791
Where's Steve Rogers?

370
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:35,041
The war ended almost 70 years ago.

371
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,625
FURY: You going to be okay?

372
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:42,000
Of course.

373
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:44,750
We won the war.

374
